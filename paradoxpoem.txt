Paradoxes

This poem is full of paradoxes,
And the first one, like this goes,
Here are the rules,
Ignore all of the rules.

Imagine inside a box, a cat and a poison-dispenser gadget,
This device will and will not remain quiet,
But while the box lid closed remains,
The cat is death and alive, the theory sustains.

The end.
